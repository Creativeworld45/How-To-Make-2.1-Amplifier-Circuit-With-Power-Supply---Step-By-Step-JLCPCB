In this project, we are going to show you making a high-power amplifier circuit. Using this circuit you will get the best quality sound. 
You can make this circuit at home easily. You can use this amplifier circuit at home, inside your car, bike, truck, etc. 
To make this circuit, you might need some electronics components, those components lists have to been given below.

Component List :

Sound IC - TDA 2030
Resistor - 1 K 10 K (2 Pieces) 150 ohm
Capacitor - 2.2uf/ 50v (2 Pieces)
PF - 2A104J


*Circuit Number : 3 
Circuit Name: Bass Booster Circuit

In This Project We Will Tech You, How To Make A Simple Bass Booster Circuit At Home Easily. You Can Make This Circuit At Very Low Cost. 

To Make This Amplifier Circuit We Will Need Some Electronics Component. Component List :

Mylar Polyester Film Capacitor – 2A104J (2 Pieces)
Resistor – 1 K Ohm & 1.5 K Ohm
Potentiometer – B 100 K

First We Connect Mylar Polyester Film Capacitor With the Left Leg Of the Potentiometer.
Then Connect Another Mylar Polyester Film Capacitor With the Right Leg Of the Potentiometer & Connect The Empty Leg Of the Mylar Polyester Film Capacitor.
Connect Potentiometer Middle Leg With Joint Leg Of Mylar Polyester Film Capacitor & Connect 1 K Resistor With Joint Leg Of Mylar Polyester Film Capacitor.
Now Connect 1.5 K Ohm Resistor With Left Leg Of Potentiometer. It Is The Time To Connect Audio Input Cable. In This Cable There Are Two Terminal. 
1st Terminal Have 3.5mm Audio Input Jack And 2nd Terminal Have Two Cable. Between These Two Cable One Is Ground (-) Cable And Another Is L/R Cable. 
Though It Is Mono Amplifier, It’s Have Two cables. If It Is Stereo Amplifier There Are Three Cable. 1st Is Ground (-), 2nd Is “L” & 3rd Is “R” Cable. 
Now Connect Audio Input Ground (-) Cable With Empty Leg Of 1.5 K Ohm Resistor And Connect Audio Input L/R Cable With Right Leg Of Potentiometer.
Now, We Use A Cable To Connect Bass Booster Circuit With Amplifier Circuit.
Connect Audio Output L/R Cable With Empty Leg Of 1 K Ohm Resistor Of Bass Booster Circuit & Ground (-) Cable With Audio Input Ground Cable Of Bass Booster Circuit. 
Now Connect Bass Booster Audio Output Cable With Audio Input Leg Of Amplifier Circuit. Our Circuit Is Now Ready For Use. 
Just Connect 3.5mm Audio Input Jack With Mobile & Play Music. Now You Can Adjust Volume Using Potentiometer.
